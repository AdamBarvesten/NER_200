# NER_200

This is a repository with material for evaluating the Hunflair corpoa on BioBERT. 

It provides the following:
* Pre-trained weights BioBERT-Base v1.1 (+ PubMED 1M) and instructions how to change this if needed
* The NER corpora from HunFlair converted to a format compatible with BioBERT and instructions how to change this if needed
* A filestructure and jupyter notebook adapted to be run on Google Colab
