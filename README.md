# NER_200

This is a repository with material for evaluating the Hunflair NER corpora on BioBERT

It provides the following: 
* Pre-trained weights BioBERT-Base v1.1 (+ PubMED 1M) 
* The NER corpora from HunFlair converted to a format compatible with BioBERT 
* Fine-tuned models where Hunflair corpora and BioBERT-Base v1.1 (+ PubMED 1M) has been used
* Resukts
* A filestructure and jupyter notebook adapted to be run on Google Colab

## Background

**BioBERT**
Please see the paper and git repository for description of BioBERT

* [DMIS-Lab BioBERT](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert/blob/master/README.md)

**HunFlair**
Please see the paper and git repository for description of HunFlair
* [HunFlair: An Easy-to-Use Tool for State-of-the-Art Biomedical Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07347)
* [FlairNLP HunFlair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR.md)
